# Extensions

Promethium has partial support for Chrome extensions (see [#110](https://github.com/wexond/desktop/issues/110)).

# Installing an extension

To install an extension, you will need to extract the `crx` file of the extension and put the extracted folder into the `extensions` directory.

The `extensions` directory paths:
- On Linux: `~/.config/promethium/extensions`
- On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%/.promethium/extensions`
- On macOS: `~/.promethium/extensions`
